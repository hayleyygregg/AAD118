Project 01
==========


Photography
-----------


Our first project was to photograph architechture of our choice using the methods of 'Macro' & 'Micro'. Before I began to think of what architecture I could photograph, I researched about photographing architecture to give me ideas and tips:

One of the articles that interested me was the heading 'It's not just about buildings' which states that when we think of arcitechture we automatically think of buildings, but other 'man-made structures' are considered architecture such as 'bridges, towers, windmills, monuments' etc. When I read this I got the idea of the sculpture at Broadway in Belfast called 'Rise'. I love this sculpture as it is so eyecatching, especially at night when it lights up, and it also has a lot of detail.

With this idea in mind, I also started to research photographing at night, as some of the websites I found that provided tips suggested photographing architecture at night as sometimes they become more alive.

For Christmas I was amazed to recieve a Pentax S-K1 from my parents! I'm not big into photography myself, but the work of others does interest me. Therefore I thought this project would be the perfect chance for me to use it! Only thing is, I'm a complete novice to photography, therefore I had to try and learn about Aperature, Exposure, Shutter Speeds and ISO, which I find confusing!
