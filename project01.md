Project 01

Photography
-----------


Our first project was to photograph architechture of our choice using the methods of 'Macro' & 'Micro'. Before I began to think of what architecture I could photograph, I researched about photographing architecture to give me ideas and tips:

* http://digital-photography-school.com/photographing-architecture/

* http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/04/24/16-tips-for-abstract-architecture-photography/

One of the articles that interested me was the heading ['It's not just about buildings'](http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/guide-to-architectural-photography) which states that when we think of arcitechture we automatically think of buildings, but other 'man-made structures' are considered architecture such as 'bridges, towers, windmills, monuments' etc. When I read this I got the idea of the sculpture at Broadway in Belfast called '[Rise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_(sculpture))'. I love this sculpture as it is so eyecatching, especially at night when it lights up, and it also has a lot of detail.

With this idea in mind, I also started to research [photographing at night](http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/02/17/night-photography-tips-9-essential-steps-for-beginners/), as some of the websites I found that provided tips suggested photographing architecture at night as sometimes they become more alive.

For Christmas I was amazed to recieve a Pentax S-K1 from my parents!

I'm not big into photography myself, but the work of others does interest me. Therefore I thought this project would be the perfect chance for me to use it! Only thing is, I'm a complete novice to photography, therefore I had to try and learn about Aperature, Exposure, Shutter Speeds and ISO, which I find confusing!


A technique that really interests me is [long exposure] (http://www.bwvision.com/ultimate-guide-long-exposure-photography/) as it captures movement that can make for a really nice photo. I first discovered this technique last year when I attempted [Light Painting](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hayleygregg/sets/72157640644359754/):

However, I did not fully understand what was going on as my brother (who is into photography) helped me, so I was interested to find out how to do it and also understand the theory of what is happening. I found a really [helpful article](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/basics/04/02.htm
) which used animations to show the relationship of Shutter Speed and Aperature and this helped me to understand what happens inside the camera during the task of capturing a photo.


Struggling to work with and find all the tools on my camera, I had to Google [how to adjust the Aperature and Shutter Speed](http://photo.net/pentax-camera-forum/00NXn9) after having no success with the manual! (embarrassing) I found a nice article which was about [photographing cityscapes at night](https://iso.500px.com/cityscape-night-photography-tips/), even though I'm not photographing a cityscape, it still gives some handy tips and also mentions 'light trails' which involves long exposure.

An article about ISO on [Digital Trends](http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/what-is-iso-camera-settings-explained/) helped me understand that the lower the ISO the better quality of the image. I also took composition into consideration, but the term 'composition' doesn't spring anything to my mind, so I decided to research it and I found an article of helpful tips '[7 Rules of Composition](https://urbantimes.co/2011/10/the-art-of-photography-accidental-composition/)' which helped jog my memory in preparation for taking photos. Looking back at the breif I decided to read about [viewpoints](https://urbantimes.co/2012/04/viewpoints-and-camera-angles/) which helped me to trash the idea of just taking a normal/common photo and do something different using angles. Someone who does this well and inspired me was Richard Weston, some examples include the [Ulster Museum](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157623516856557) and [Ferry](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157630663211464/). I actually like a lot of his photos, I like the image below because by the tree being upside down it makes for a more interesting image, which is what Weston is all about.

When looking at different photography techniques I came across [Zoom Bursts](http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/07/11/4-ways-to-make-more-creative-zoom-burst-photos/) which can make a really interesting photo and how using long shutter speeds you can actually [capture the earth rotating](http://www.exposureguide.com/night-sky-photography-tips.htm)!
